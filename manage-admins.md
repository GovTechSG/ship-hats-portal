## Add project admins

Subscription Admins can add Project Admins using the SHIP-HATS portal. When creating a project in an account, it is mandatory to specify at least one Project Admin. SAs can add additional PAs anytime in the future.  

<!--
> **Note:** The number of PAs each project is entitled to is based on the [subscription tier](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/ship-hats-getting-started/#/subscription) quota for which the agency has subscribed.
-->

### To add a project admin

1. From the side menu, click **Projects** to view all the projects in this subscription account. 

    > **Tip:** If needed, [Switch account](manage-account).

1. Locate the project, and then click three dots for more options.
1. Click **Manage Admins**. 
1. Click **Add New**.  
1. In the **Select Admin** drop down list, select the required user.

    >**Note:** Users will appear here only if they were added in the [TechBiz portal](https://portal.techbiz.suite.gov.sg/). <!--If *First Name* and *Last Name* were not provided when creating a new user account, email address will appear in the drop-down list.-->
1. Click **Add** to add this user as a project admin.  
   
   After a user is successfully added, an email notification will be sent to the requesting SA with copy sent to other SA and the newly added PA.
