## Add project admins

Subscription Admins can add Project Admins using the SHIP-HATS portal. When creating a project in an account, it is mandatory to specify at least one Project Admin. SAs can add additional PAs anytime in the future.  

<!--
> **Note:** The number of PAs each project is entitled to is based on the [subscription tier](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/ship-hats-getting-started/#/subscription) quota for which the agency has subscribed.
-->

### To add a project admin


1. From the side menu, click **Workspace**.

    > **Tip:** If needed, [Switch account](manage-account).

    The **Systems** screen appears, displaying all the systems added to your subscription.
